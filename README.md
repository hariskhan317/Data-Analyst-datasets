# Data-Analyst-datasets

## Description
This repository contains a data processing project that aims to clean and enhance a dataset related to job listings. The project involves various data transformations and cleaning steps to make the dataset more informative and user-friendly. The changes made to the original dataset are outlined below.

## Data Preprocessing Steps
* Replacing Column Name: The column named "Column1" has been renamed to "ID" for better clarity and understanding of the data.

* Replacing -1 with Null: The dataset had some values represented by -1, which were not meaningful. These values have been replaced with null to indicate missing or unknown data.

* Splitting Location Column: The "Location" column has been split into two new columns: "City" and "State." This enhancement provides a clearer view of job locations and facilitates analysis based on cities or states.

* Splitting Headquaters Column: Similar to the location column, the "Headquaters" column has been split into two new columns: "Headquaters City" and "Headquaters State" to provide better insights into the company's location.

* Trimming Salary Estimate: The "Salary Estimate" column contained extra text, making it difficult to use the data effectively. The extra text has been removed, leaving only the relevant salary information.

* Replacing Column Name: The column named "Size" has been renamed to "Company_Size" to improve data readability and to make it more descriptive.

* Fixing Company_Size Data: The "Company_Size" column contained data that was not uniform or easily understandable. This column has been standardized and cleaned to provide a consistent representation of company sizes.

* Fixing Revenue Column Data: The "Revenue" column originally contained string values, which were not suitable for numerical analysis. The data has been converted to integer format for better analysis and visualization.

* Replacing Null Values in "Eassy Apply" Column: The "Eassy Apply" column had null values, which have been replaced with "False" to indicate that the application process is not easy for those particular entries.

* Deleting Unwanted Columns: Certain columns were identified as unnecessary for the project's objectives and analysis. These columns have been removed from the dataset to reduce clutter and enhance data focus.
